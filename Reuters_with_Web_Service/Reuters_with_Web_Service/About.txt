“New Reuters” likes “DBTele”, “Reuters” and “DBGraphic” which could be insert wires or photo (pictures) from Reuters.

For this program, It can compatible with different version of EMS system such as EMS6.01, EMS4.0, Metro’s EMS etc. 
Each version can be change the config file item “<add key="EMS_Version" value="(EMS Version No.)" />”.

For different EMS system could have different database structure. 
With modify the config option, you can find different setting on each parameter.

This program is based on EMS6.0 version during the development, so all the default layout will follow EMS6.0 setting.

Since that contains some coding about connected to Reuters web service but it seems that are not stable and low speed performance.
So all the related functions were disabled.
